    One of the things that makes Privateer Security Forces unique is a tech savvy business model that puts the power of modern day computing and robotics into the hands of our well trained privateers. Equally important, however, is knowing when to keep the tech OUT of the hands of our privateers, as well. A major pitfall of virtually all of the current security guard management softwares on the market is that they focus on a mobile device centric design that, by it's very design, requires a security professional to have his or her attention constantly diverted to the screen of a mobile device. Not only does this look unprofessional, drawing the disapproval of onlookers who don't understand that the phone is actually <i>doing</i> the job, versus <i>not</i> doing the job, but it's <strong> <i>very</i> dangerous.</strong>

    A security professional must, at all times while on patrol, be focused on his or her surroundings and the constantly evolving environment he or she is contracted to protect. A distracted security professional cannot perform his or her duties effectively or safely wth their eyes glued to a mobile device! To this end, we created our flagship software product, "Full Sail". Full Sail is designed by security and law enforcement professionals who know how to write code professionally as well. The software is designed from experience on the job, and adds a plethora of great features that greatly enhance the user's capabilities while providing the same quality features users have grown to expect from a security operations management application.

    Full Sail is currently in development with a Beta release date scheduled for Q4 2021!
