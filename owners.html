            <h1>Cody Salazar-Betzer</h1>
            <small>President</small>

            <img src="images\37.jpg" class="img-fluid m-2 col-lg-1 col-md-1 col-sm-12 float-start"/>

            <p> 
                Cody was born in Tucson, AZ and has over 15 years of experience in private security and intelligence, and over 20 simultaneous years in cyber security, software development and robotics.  
            </p> 

            <p>
                Cody was born into a law enforcement family, and spent his adolescent days hanging around the police station, or participating in a near perpetual ride-along with his law enforcement parent. It is a fair statement to proclaim that Cody was born and raised to be a protector. As fate would have it, however, his joy for puzzles and problem solving intially led him in the direction of software development, and by the time he was a high school grad, Cody was already a seasoned software developer and mischievous but harmless electronic prankster. In college, he was working for oil and gas companies in Texas, developing powerful and secure data and document management systems, and developed the Mineral Ownership Report Generator (MOR Generator) - a software that produces intelligent, grammatically correct legal land owenership documents. Cody started his first solo business venture in 2005 at age of 19 - Revolusys. Revolusys was a Dallas - Fort Worth technology company that enjoyed a niche in the oil and gas industry, deploying physical networks in a semi-mobile capacity and data solutions that tailored to the challenging requirements of the oil field. The business thrived through the famous market crash of 2008, until the last of the oil and gas clients closed their doors in 2011. 
            </p>

            <img src="images\Ex_Baller.jpg" class="img-fluid m-2 col-lg-1 col-md-1 col-sm-12 float-end"/>

            <p>
                It was during this time - approximately 2008 - that Cody found his success with Revolusys to simply not be enough. He longed for the action and excitement he was raised to experience, and decided to enroll in an executive protection / pistol class for fun. The class was only 3 days, but Cody learned a lot and was hooked. Having only recently reached legal age to own firearms, Cody quickly amassed a large collection, a habit he continues to pursue to this day, and continued regularly taking firearms classes all over America, as often as possible. Eventually, by pure chance, Cody happened upon the opportunity to function as the head of security and personal protection for a major hip hop artist. During this time, Cody traveled the country with A list hop hop celebrities, and experienced the everyday lifestyle of VIP protection in an urban environment. From vehicular transportation to VIP arrangement and security pre-screens at every location on a celebrity stop list, Cody learned the ropes and thrived as a full-time executive security professional in the evenings while simultaneously running the technology company in the day, taking time off and delegating duties to allow for time and duties elsewhere. 
            </p>

            <p>
                After Cody decided to close the doors on Revolusys in 2011, he performed VIP security exclusively, full time, until 2012, when he decided to put a "hiatus on everything" and moved to South Padre Island, TX. There, he took time with his wife and two children and "enjoyed the island life". Feeling bored after only a short time, he started another company: Desert Rain Interactive Studios. DRI Studios quickly became a 3rd party game developer for Bohemia Interactive Studios, working on the "Arma 3" title. Combining passions as he tends to do, he produced "The PMC Simulator", an add-on to the world-famous title that put the player in the position of a private security company owner, managing a budget, soliciting contracts with clients, and hiring soldiers to engage in conflicts and keep peace on the fictional game island. Cody pushed the games engine to it's edges, and created unique and entertaining "job experiences" for the player and his or her AI team, such a roadblocks, VIP escorts, intelligence gathering missions, and more. The add-on gained immense popularity in Japan and Russia, receiving ample coverage from popular gaming youtube personalities and reports, but received only a mediocre response in the United States. Nevertheless, to this day, Cody still receives inquiries, requests, and compliments on the game, nearly a decade later!
            </p>

                <img src="images\CodyAndBorderPatrol.png" class="img-fluid m-2 col-lg-2 col-md-1 col-sm-12 float-start"/>
                The development of PMC Simulator game was the start of Cody's dream to start his own security company. While the game development company was fun and successful, a life behind a computer was having a negative effect on Cody's health, and Cody once again longed for the fulfillment of protecting others that he was raised to enjoy. He returned to school, attending S2 Safety & Intelligence Institute and receiving his diploma in anti-terrorism and certification as an anti-terrorism officer (with a minor in crisis negotiation) in 2016. Cody immediately abandoned his game development company to seek a career in Anti-Terrorism Intelligence, and worked until he acquired a position with an intelligence gathering organization, gathering intelligence on the United States Border. Cody utilized his knowledge of computer technology, electronics, and physics to perform anti-narcotics and anti-human trafficking operations on the U.S. Border with Mexico, and was trained in traditional military and law enforcement narcotics and human trafficking interdiction disciplines. He served on the U.S. Border in a combat reconnaissance capacity and participated in numerous operations. During this time, he also became certified as a level 4 Tactical Tracker, a esoteric skillset that allows the tracking of humans, aging of sign and visual assessment of crime scenes. He's been featured in Soldier of Fortune Magazine twice, in a PBS documentary twice, on VICE once, and various other international news outlets' stories worldwide!

            </p>
            
            <p> 
                In early 2020, Cody concluded that he had experienced enough to (mostly) sate his hunger for action. His will had changed, and was now training, and passing his skills and experiences on to the next generation of protectors. He again combined skill sets, went back to school and became an NRA certified Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun and Personal Protection in The Home Instructor, A DPS unarmed guard instructor, and a DPS armed guard instructor, a CPR instructor, and then opened "Attanaya Warrior Institute". AWI is a 2000+ square foot laser based firearms simulation training facility. This facility utilizes expensive, cutting edge computer simulators that put the user in the middle of a real-life situation. The simulated people can see you, hear you, and respond to your actions. The laser guns are high tech copies of the real thing, and use gas-blowback and lasers to simulate recoil and allow the user to interact with the simulator using words, firearms, pepper spray, taser, and more! The high tech simulation business did well, but the COVID crisis of 2020 was a difficult time for the new venture, and in late 2020, Cody decided that the huge investment in the training facility was best utilized by teaming it up with his other passion - security. Thus, Privateer Security Forces was born! Cody now owns and manages PSF full time, and doubles as the owner and commander of Privateer Academy.

            <h1>Our Team</h1>
            <small>The heart and soul of PSF</small>

            <img src="images\IMG_20220929_103058494_HDR.jpg" class="img-fluid m-2 col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12 float-start"/>

            <p> 
                Privateers are a rare and unique breed. We are small, we are few, but we are insanely mighty. PSF employs a diverse team of professionals, hailing from all walks of life. We are an equal opportunity employer, and since we train in house,
                from the ground up, we have access to a wide pool of potential candidates whose only initial requirement to apply is courage, grit, and determination to be a part of something bigger than themselves. We are a youthful team, strong and able.
                Each and every person who calls themselves a "Privateer" has earned the title through intensive training and desire to succeed - to be the best. That's not to say that none of our team come from military and law enforcement backgrounds,
                as most do! But for every expert who has 15 years of combat experience, we have a student learning what they know, and applying it to our operations here.
