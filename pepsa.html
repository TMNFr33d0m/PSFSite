Utilizing the same guidelines as set forth by the privatization of our prison systems, a city shall determine whether the municipal force shall remain, or be replaced by a private entity such as a private security company. Regardless of the outcome of the decision, the vote to retain or replace entirely the organization responsible for law enforcement in our community shall occur every two(2) years.
