<h1>Our Academy</h1>
<p> 
    At Privateer, we believe that liability is a direct result of training. We beleieve that the state mandated minimums are far too small. 8 hours of training is enough to create a cashier, or a door man, but not enough to train a security professional. Nevertheless, 8 hours is all it takes to become a security guard in Arizona. For armed security, another 16 hours is all that's required, and 8 of that is spent on a firing range. We then arm those people and turn them loose on an wary and untrusting public. By comparison, police departments on average require officers to complete 672 hours of basic training before joining the force. That's <i> 84 times </i> the training! Privateer academy aims to close that gap and create a professional that's well trained for security functions without the unessecary and inapplicable law enforcement functions taught in the police academy. Our minimum training for armed security is an <i> 80 hour </i> private security academy that focuses on the esoteric skillset required to create high quality security professionals that maximize effectiveness in duty while minimizing liability through an intense education program. Our Privateers, once hired from the academy and deployed to active service, are then continually educated in our cutting edge facilities on a weekly basis, sharpening and developing skills over time, and eventually learning specialty skills specific to contracts and roles.
