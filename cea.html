<h1>Critical Enforcement Area</h1>
<h3>Teaming up community leaders to improve safety for all.</h3>
<p> 
    A Critical Enforcement Area (CEA) is a fancy name for a simple concept - expense sharing. Often times, business owners that require security have a business location that is unfortunately in a "bad area". Often times, these areas don't permit the kind of income that is required to maintain to 24/7 presence, and they're too criminally active for a simple patrol presence to be effective. A CEA is our answer to this problem, creating a "happy medium" that allows local business owners to share the expense and presence of a privateer over a small area. The privateer patrols randomly and constantly between the locations encompassed in the CEA (usually about one mile) providing increased security for all businesses included in the CEA. As CEA areas get bigger, more Privateers and more assets are assigned to keep up with the demand.

    CEAs are great for "cleaning up" an area that is seeing an uptick in criminal activity, and keeping local communities safer courtesy of the community leaders that support them. CEAs can be used as a positive contribution to the community and advertised as such to the benefit of the clients. Depending on the size of the CEA, assets may include drone technology, patrol vehicles, critical response team assignments and more.
