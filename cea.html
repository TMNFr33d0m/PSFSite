    A Critical Enforcement Area (CEA) is a fancy name for a simple concept - shared community responsibility. Often times, business owners that require enhanced security have a business location that is situated in a challenging area. Often times, these areas are too criminally active for a simple patrol presence to be effective, and a full time presence is too large of a financial burden for one business owner to shoulder alone, as well as less effective when troublemakers leave the property but fail to leave the area.  A CEA is our answer to these problems, creating a "happy medium" between patrol and a static post that allows local business owners to share the expense and presence of a privateer over a small area. The privateer patrols randomly and constantly between the locations encompassed in the CEA (usually about one mile) providing increased security for all businesses included in the CEA. As CEA areas get bigger, more Privateers and more assets are assigned to keep up with the demand.

    CEAs are designed to be applied as a method for improving safety and security in an area that is seeing an uptick in criminal activity, and keeping local communities safer courtesy of the community leaders that support them. CEAs can be used as a positive contribution to the community, and clients can often utilize this contribution in public relations. Depending on the size of the CEA, assets may include drone technology, patrol vehicles, critical response team assignments and more. CEAs are also an effective way to raise property values in a community by lowering crime, deterring offenders regionally and mitigating the effects of urban blight in the area.
