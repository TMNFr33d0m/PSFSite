        <p class="">
            At Privateer Security Forces, we pride ourselves on being the most advanced and well-equipped private paramilitary security force in Arizona, offering a range of services that set us apart from our competitors. Our commitment to providing the best possible security solutions to our clients means that we stay on the cutting edge of technology and training to ensure that we are always one step ahead of potential threats.</p>

        <img class="img-fluid mb-2 col-lg-2 col-md-2 col-sm-12 float-start" src="images\PrivateerBadge.png" />

          </video>
        
        <p class="">
            One of the key factors that sets us apart is our proprietary security guard training academy curriculum. Our privateers learn the esoteric art of visual tracking, and learn to read sign and use it for security purposes. Our training program is 80 hours long, four times longer than our competitors who only complete a maximum of 24 hours for armed security. What's more, our privateers receive 20 hours of training every month after the initial 80 hours. This training covers a wide range of topics, including firearms, psychological training on how to deal with subjects, and medical training, ensuring that our privateers are always up-to-date with the latest techniques and best practices.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            In addition to our world-class training, we are proud to offer our clients access to our proprietary software, Full Sail. Installed on laptops mounted in our patrol cars, Full Sail works as a computer-aided dispatch, a reporting interface, collects information on offenders, intelligence, and is able to host a guest list or resident list that we can verify against and associate guests for visitor tracking. Our software is the only software out there that allows a security guard to search vehicle license plate information and get real-time results, including stolen car detection directly from the Arizona Attorney General's Office. We report all patrols with dashcam footage, and all incident reports with bodycam footage. The client can access this information via our online portal on our website. They can also set post orders via our comprehensive post order management platform and communicate with their privateers using this system.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            Our PTTOC radios provide instant communication between our privateers, our dispatcher, and our clients, utilizing 4G cellular networks to allow for quick and seamless communication in real-time. PTTOC stands for Push-To-Talk Over Cellular, and this means that in the event of an emergency, our privateers can quickly and easily call for backup or communicate with the client to ensure that the situation is resolved as quickly and effectively as possible. We also offer 24-hour dispatch, and the dispatcher works the PTTOC radio system. The client can call the dispatcher and have security dispatched over the radio and the Computer Aided Dispatch system.
        </p> 

        <p class="">
            We recently added HALO bodycams to our arsenal. HALO Technologies is a third-party company that specializes in fixed-cost Body Cam solutions. With years of frontline experience in the UK, European, and Asian Body Camera sectors, they have developed a bespoke, turn-key Body Cam, DAMS software solution, and full situational awareness package for the US market. HALO bodycams provide clear and accurate footage even in low light situations, ensuring that our privateers can capture everything that happens during their patrols. These bodycams integrate seamlessly with all other digital media types, allowing you to access and build one case in one place easily.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            We also use DJI Mavic Mini 2 Drones, which are like having police helicopters in our pockets. These drones are incredibly versatile and can be used to monitor large areas quickly and effectively. This means that we can cover more ground in less time, allowing us to respond quickly to potential threats and take action to protect our clients. 
        </p>

        <p class="">
            At Privateer Security Forces, we take a unique approach to intelligence gathering, employing certified intelligence analysts and using our own motion sensor system. Our proprietary motion sensor system is called Advanced Motion Sensor Tracking System (AMSTS), and it utilizes tripod-mounted sensors and driveway alarms with 8 channels to detect movement and provide real-time intelligence on potential threats. This system is a trade secret, and we take great pride in the fact that it sets us apart from our competitors. Our intelligence analysts decipher the information collected by AMSTS and create real security and risk profiles and predictions based on this data. This allows us to provide our clients with real-time security assessments and intelligence reports, giving them the insight they need to make informed decisions about their security.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            We also use motion-activated trail cams to gather intelligence on drug dealers and criminals for property management companies. We wear disguises and use our proprietary system called the Tactical Intelligence Gathering System (TIGS), which is a military-sounding name that stands for Targeted Intelligence Gathering System. This system involves hiding cameras in strategic locations to capture footage of criminal activity, which we can then use to help our clients evict drug dealers using their homes as drug distribution points. Our TIGS system is also a trade secret, and we take great pride in the fact that it allows us to provide our clients with the intelligence they need to take action against criminal activity.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            Finally, we are the only security company in Arizona with full ownership of a 63-acre urban training ground, the "Private Security Academy." This facility is enhanced with multiple virtual reality simulators used by elite law enforcement and military agencies worldwide, as well as professional physical training facilities, personal trainers, internal medical staff, and much more. This means that our privateers have access to the most advanced and comprehensive training available, ensuring that they are the most skilled and physically fit security force in the state.
        </p>

        <p class="">
            In summary, Privateer Security Forces is the most advanced and well-equipped private military force in Arizona, offering a range of services that set us apart from our competitors. Our proprietary security guard training academy curriculum, Full Sail software, PTTOC radios, HALO bodycams, DJI Mavic Mini 2 Drones, AMSTS, TIGS, and Private Security Academy all combine to make us the most skilled and technologically advanced security force in the state. We take great pride in providing our clients with the highest level of security available, and we are committed to staying on the cutting edge of technology and training to ensure that we are always one step ahead of potential threats.
