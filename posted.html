<h1>Posted Security Services: </h1>

<p>Posted security services are the traditional mode of security most people know about. A Privateer is contracted to be on premises at your location for a set shift, on a set schedule. Most of the time, you will have the same Privateer on your premises, and he or she may perform special duties that add to the productivity of your business or streamline the processes at your facility, including searches, locks / unlocks, access control, surveillance monitoring, peace keeping operations, safety operations, and more.
