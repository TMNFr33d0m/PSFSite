<p class="">
    Static post security services are traditional security services that include a dedicated privateer assigned to your location for a set number of hours. It all starts with a hands-on, in person, <strong>FREE</strong> consultation, during which our risk assessors will complete an assessment using our patent-pending RiSkore risk assessment system. Once the assessment is completed, you will discuss the findings in detail with your Privateer rep and determine what security solutions you would like to implement, and how you would like them implemented. 
</p>

<p class=""> 
    Once your Privateer rep finishes the paperwork and gets you into the computer system, we assign a supervisory Privateer temporarily to the location. During the supervisory privateer's time at the site, the privateer will test the post orders in action and notify his or her high commander of any potential risks or pitfalls that should be paid attention prior to the assignment of your permanent privateer. It is during this time that we will select our best fitting privateer from our available assets and begin any testing, training, certification and continuing education upgrades needed for the privateer to function at his or her highest and best capacity.  
</p>
    
<p class="">
    After a short time, your supervisory privateer will conclude his or her duties, and hand the post - with fully developed post order - over to your permanent privateer!

    PSF offers two types of posted privateers, both of which are <strong> ARMED </strong>:

    <h2>Drone and Automated Technologies</h2>

        <p>
            Privateer utilizes automation and drone technology whenever possible to maximize the effectiveness of our assets in the field. Quadcopter drone technology is a safe, effective way for Privateers to multiply their force presence and capabilities by allowing them to cover and see more ground, record what they see, investigate from above, and maintain a safe distance from situations where direct intervention is not required. Quadcopter drones also allow privateers to temporarily double their presence by physically holding one location and using the drone to patrol another. This is especially effective for posts where the privateer needs to maintain control of a specific area at a site, but is also responsible for security in additional areas simultaneously. 
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition to quadcopter drones, our privateers may utilize portable surveillance camera systems, motion detection devices, wireless summoning devices, sound enhancement devices, night vision, optics and other technologies as applicable to assist the privateer with the performance of his or her duties. The use and mastery of these technologies allow our professionals to employ powerful security solutions that are efficient, cost effective, and highly impressive.
