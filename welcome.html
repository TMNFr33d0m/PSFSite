<h1>Safety, Security, Solutions. </h1>

<p>
   Privateer Security Forces provides traditional and specialty physical security solutions that include the latest technology and personnel with training that exceeds the state minimums by orders of magnitude. We believe that training directly mitigates all liability, and we have invested heavily in an intense, propriety training program and a high tech training academy that creates professional private security professionals with over 10 times the training that other armed security guards receive. Our alumni are not simply "security guards", but instead earn a much more prestigious title: "PRIVATEER".

    PSF prides itself on being well educated, well equipped, and highly organized. We utilize cutting edge technology to our maximum benefit, and our efficiency and internal capabilities benefit as a direct result. Utilizing drone technology, we can provide our Privateers with high tech surveillance solutions that allow them to perform their security functions. Utilizing radio over mobile technology, our organization enjoys company-wide communications, blue force tracking, group messaging and more! As a direct result, our clients enjoy better security services from better informed Privateers, and a scalable security force that can amass and disperse as needed to maintain peace and order.

    At Privateer, we aren't JUST a security company, however. We're also in the business of developing quality security operations software that our clients and Privateers can count on. Our flagship product, "Full Sail", is a security operations suite (currently in development) that allows us to track offenders and incidents, offense counts, and other data required to build strong cases over time that hold legal weight and garner real results. Our internal systems also allow us to report incidents and activity in our own unique way, throwing the traditional bloated third party system used by so many security companies directly into the dumpster! Our Full Sail suite will provide enhanced communication with your Privateers and detailed control over your security protocols!
