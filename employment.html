            <h1>Becoming A Privateer</h1>
            <p>
                Becoming a Privateer is a not just a career. It's a lifestyle. The experience of being a Privateer is like none other in the world. Caught somewhere in limbo between security guard, private military contractor, law enforcement officer, firefighter and paramedic, Privateers engage in a wide range of training outings on a regular basis, and are expected to respond to a wide range of stimuli, from critical, life threatening emergencies to everyday customer service interactions. 
            </p> 
            <p> 
                Being a Privateer isn't easy. It requires courage, grit, determination, and an unbreakable work ethic. A Privateer is pledged not only to our organization, but to themselves, to be the best version of themselves at all times. PSF assists our Privateers in this endeavor by owning our own high tech training academy, equipped with multiple firearms simulators, a hand to hand combat area, a physical training area, a classroom, a medical training and simulation area, and an urban training area. With all of this equipment at our disposal, we strive to keep our Privateers in the training facility, building themselves and their skills, whenever possible. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Training:</h2>
            <p>
                Privateer Academy is one of the most advanced security academies in the world. We don't say that lightly. We've invested in the latest, most cutting edge firearms and non-lethal situation simulators, medical training devices, and training materials. We're NRA certified instructors in all weapons disciplines, and our instructors are all seasoned veterans. Our academy curriculum <i>starts</i> at <strong>40 hours.</strong> Compare to that state minimum of 8 hours. In this unique 40 hour academy, candidates will perform light physical training, spend extensive time in the classroom learning about law and theory, enter our high tech, cutting edge simulators, enter our combat gym, and spend time in the field with our instructors learning esoteric skills such as security patrol and man tracking.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next 40 hours are almost entirely dedicated to firearms training. Privateers learn to handle and demonstrate proficiency in pistol, rifle and shotgun platforms, and receive NRA certifications in all three disciplines. They spend more time in the classroom learning about use of force law, and more time in the simulators learning about complex scenarios, de-escalation, active shooter response, hostage situations, bomb threats, domestic disputes, and more! Finally, Privateers spend time on the live fire range with all of the weapon platforms, beginning a repeating phase of firearms training that will last the duration of the Privateer's career. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The pay as a Privateer is closely comparable to law enforcement, and far in excess of the security industry average. The equipment we utilize is high tech, top notch equipment that is typically reserved for law enforcement and elite military units. To this end, we view our organization as a collection of elite security professionals, and demand the highest level of performance from our employees. It is difficult to become a Privateer, and maintaining the title requires constant self discipline. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Hiring Process</h2>
            <p>
                Many security companies are known for hiring "just anybody". It's possible to interview and hire on with most companies in the same day. Due to the nature of our operations at PSF, we must follow a much different process. Our company strives to maintain the public trust, and we believe the only way to mitigate liability is through the stringent training processes we employ. Not everyone is cut out for this training, however, and we aim to mitigate our losses and candidate's disappointment by employing a strict hiring process that demands the best from our candidates. Our hiring process is as follows: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Application: Candidates interested in becoming Privateers may <a href="mailto:communication@privateersecurity.com"> submit their resumes to the company via our Email</a>. Our online application process is coming soon!</li>
                    <li>Preliminary Interview: If the applicant is selected for an interview, applicant will be invited to our headquarters or hiring field office to conduct an in person interview. This will be a formal interview designed to get to know the applicant and evaluate applicant's mannerisms and articulacy. The candidate will also submit all required information for a background investigation at this time. </li>
                    <li>Background Investigation: If the applicant is selected to move forward in the hiring process, we will conduct a thorough background investigation to determine the applicant's eligibility to earn the title of Privateer. The background investigation will include checks of current and former employment, police, financial, education and military records as well as interviews with references. </li>
                    <li>Background Interview: After the background investigation is complete, and provided the applicant can move forward in the hiring process, the applicant will be called in for a second interview. This interview will address any questions regarding the findings of the background report, and clarify experience and other historical information. </li>
                    <li>Psychological Evaluation: A written Psychological exam will be administered to the candidate. </li>
                    <li>Final Interview: The final interview will be conducted by a member of Command Staff and either the direct supervisor or member of Human Resources Division. The panel will evaluate candidates to assess their interpersonal skills, oral communication skills and qualifications for a Privateer. If successful, the candidate may be given a conditional job offer. </li>
                    <li>Medical Evaluation: A pre-employment medical screening is required to determine the medical fitness of the candidate. </li>
                    <li>Privateer Academy: Prior to assignment, candidates will undergo a two week, 80 hour intensive training academy. No current certifications exempt candidates from the academy. During the academy, the physical and mental limits of the candidate will be tested, and the candidate will be subject to washout due to request, injury, or disqualification. </li>
                    <li>Probationary Period: After graduating the Privateer Academy, there is a 30 day probationary period. During this time, the probationary privateer will be subject to certain restrictions and enhanced oversight, and will embark on "training operations" with supervisors and team leaders to learn the additional skills and routines of his or her specific assignment.</li>
                    <li>Graduation: After successful completion of the probationary period, the Privateer graduates from probationary status and receives his or her assignments and status as a certified Privateer!</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <h3> A message from the owner:</h3>
            <p>
                Hi, my name is Cody Betzer, and I am one of the owners a Privateer Security Forces. I have lived a great deal of my life in a uniform of some sort, and a large portion of that has been in the private security field. I also come from a background of recon and intelligence, and I bring a lot of my knowledge from that field to the academy and security company we have built today. We have recognized the hard truths about the private security industry, and we aim to correct them with this company. The days of low pay, long, thankless hours, and untrained slobs in ratty uniforms are GONE in the world we've created here. We're motivated, we love the security industry, and we're not afraid to go where other companies have been terrified to tread. We've worked for these other companies, and we've toiled and suffered at the hands of cowardice and greed. We built this company to fill the gap created by companies who are unwilling to be better by focusing on the obvious functions that improve security effectiveness, and not "getting away with the cheapest expense and the highest income possible". So many companies today cut corners and pinch pennies, so badly, that both the security guards and the clients suffer tremendously. We at PSF are taking a stand. Our company is determined to pay fair, decent wages; to use the best equipment and most cutting edge technology available, and to tread where few companies dare because they are unwilling to risk a financial expenditure. To that end, our company is determined to be the best, not the richest. We will provide the best security, and the best value, to our clients. We will do this because we have the right tools, the best people, and the highest motivation, because we love our jobs and protecting our communities. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I once worked with a guy who told me he applied for his job at the security company we both worked for because he reasoned that the position was the "laziest possible job he could get paid for". Disgusted, I knew right then that there were two types of guards out there: guards that are here to do a good job, and guards that are here just to collect a paycheck. I have no interest in a guard that just wants to collect a paycheck. What we're creating here is not a job where we accept contracts as glorified door men, photographers or human security cameras. Those jobs are for people who are just here to collect a paycheck. And more power to them. That's them, and those companies that hire them. We won't mention their names, but they know who they are. We are different. We're here to do a job. Laziness isn't in our vocabulary. As a security guard, I would walk 8-10 miles a day. I would walk 4-5 as a patrolman, just getting out of my car and patrolling sites on foot. I'm not looking for people who are scared off by those facts. There's a place for those people, but it isn't here. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                In return for the best candidates and their best efforts, we will give you a decent wage you can feed your family and pay your bills with. We will negotiate contracts that ensure you have all the knowledge, tools, and authority to complete your job duties with as little risk and danger as possible. We will ensure you have ample training to do your job, and handle any situation you may encounter. Most importantly, we will support you, and treat you like a valued asset and treasured investment, instead of a disposable tool, which is how I felt at many of the companies I have previously worked at. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                If you feel like you have what it takes to join our family and share our vision, I encourage you to embark on the journey of becoming a Privateer. We're leading the way to a safer community. You should lead with us. 
            </p>
