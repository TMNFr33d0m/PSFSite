</p>

<h2> We invest in success!</h2>

<p>Our patrol privateers are equipped with the best and most advanced equipment in the industry! We are the ONLY company in Arizona that is able to offer body and dash cam footage of a vast majority of our incidents. Our body cameras, standard issue, record audio and video in 4K high definition, ensuring every detail is recorded in the highest clarity. Our in-vehicle dash camera system records simultaneously, providing multiple angles and perspectives for many incidents. Our camera systems are designed and integrated to produce maximum evidentiary value while simultaneously drastically reducing liability to all parties involved. </p>

<p>In the way of communications, our patrol privateers enjoy 5G internet based two-way radio communications, giving them an instant link to supervisory assistance, backup requests, and emergency services requests. Our dispatchers are available 24/7, and are linked into the same computer systems the patrol privateers use, creating a security operations center that rivals the capacity of many police departments.</p>

<p>All of our patrol vehicles are equipped with state of the art security lighting technology, creating an impressive and authoritative display visible from thousands of yards away, and providing our privateers with powerful advantages in low light conditions. Our on-board computer systems in every patrol vehicle include real time GPS tracking, digitized reporting, internal reporting and database inquiry capability and even the ability to run license plate information!</p>

<p>Finally, we are the ONLY company in Arizona to provide our Patrol Privateers with quadcopter drones. These mini drones, weighing in at less than 249kg, will fit in the palm of your hand. They provide our privateers with powerful overwatch capabilities, allowing privateers to use them much like law enforcement uses a helicopter. Getting a wide view of an area, or investigating an area that is difficult to reach, is no issue at all with our advanced drone technology!</p>

<h2> How it works:</h2>
<p>
    Patrols are sold in 15 minute blocks of time, during which our privateers will utilize their patrol vehicles for high visibility presence, lighting up dark areas and searching the premises for unsafe or unlawful activity. When advantageous, the privateer may park the patrol vehicle and dismount for enforcement action, foot patrols, to set up drone technology, enter and check exterior structure points not visible otherwise, and perform other related tasks. Should the privateer encounter an incident, a NEW 15-minute timer starts, and the privateer will react to the incident according the post orders defined by you, our client, using our patent-pending post order management system. Incidents resolved within the 15-minute incident block are free, even if the incident requires the privateer to stay up to double the patrol block time! In the event an incident extends longer than the 15-minute incident block, Privateer prevents the incident from becoming an expensive catastrophe to our clients with our flat rate incident fees. All incidents will be recorded via an incident report, and the report will be made available to our client online with supporting body cam, dash cam, and other media. <a href="https://www.privateersecurity.com/ClientMedia/GRICOA/10-14-2021/SIR-20211014-2.mp4">See a sample!</a> Each session is concluded with a digital report as well, documenting the patrol and and relatable information encountered on the patrol. Reports are made available to our clients on our website utilizing our client dashboard!

<h3>Flat Rate Special Incident Fee</h3>
<p>
    As mentioned before, every incident that your privateer engages in on behalf of your estate or company starts a 15 minute timer, regardless of the status of the patrol timer. An incident that starts at the 14 minute mark of a 15 minute patrol means that the client will receive up to 30 minutes of service for the cost of one patrol hit! Privateers are trained and expected to resolve most incidents within 15 minutes, and achieve this goal at an astonishing rate. On occasion, however, the situation your Privateer may be faced with may dictate a prolonged response, such as an arrest with detention for police arrival. These incidents can extend for unreasonable durations as the workload and response time of law enforcement varies. At Privateer, we understand that a criminal's actions causing a limitless bleeding of security funds is not much different than the criminal stealing the funds themselves, and we have developed a solution to mitigate this problem - flat rate incident fees. Flat rate incident fees share the risk with our clients by ensuring that incidents are resolved quickly and peacefully, or the additional cost is on us. In the event an emergency incident extend longer than 15 minutes, and is resolved within one hour and 15 minutes from the time of the start of the Privateer's engagement in the incident, the flat rate fee is only $75.00! In the event the incident extends past 1 hour, up to 4 hours, the flat rate fee is only $135.00! By sharing this risk, we guarantee a safer community at a rate that our competition simply cannot match!
