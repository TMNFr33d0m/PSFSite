            <h1 class="mt-4">Capt. Cody Betzer</h1>
            <small>President, Managing Partner</small>
            
            <p class="lead">Cody, born in Tucson, AZ, is a seasoned professional with a diverse background in private security, intelligence, cyber security, software development, and robotics. With over 15 years of experience in private security and intelligence, and over 20 years in cyber security, software development, and robotics, Cody brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to his roles.</p>

            <img src="images\37.jpg" class="img-fluid m-2 col-lg-1 col-md-1 col-sm-12 float-start"/>

            <h2 class="pt-3">Early Life and Entrepreneurship</h2>
            <p>Cody was born into a law enforcement family and developed a passion for protecting others from a young age. While his initial inclination was towards software development, Cody's desire for action led him to enroll in executive protection and pistol classes. This experience ignited his interest in security and personal protection.</p>
            
            <img src="images\Ex_Baller.jpg" class="img-fluid m-2 col-lg-1 col-md-1 col-sm-12 float-end"/>
            <p>After running a successful technology company, Revolusys, which catered to the oil and gas industry, Cody decided to pursue his passion for security full-time. He served as the head of security and personal protection for a major hip hop artist, traveling across the country and gaining firsthand experience in VIP protection.</p>

            <h2>Entrepreneurship and Game Development</h2>
            <p>Following the closure of Revolusys, Cody took a hiatus and eventually founded Desert Rain Interactive Studios. The studio became a 3rd party game developer for Bohemia Interactive Studios, working on the popular title "Arma 3." Cody's unique combination of passions led him to create "The PMC Simulator," an add-on that provided players with a private security company management experience within the game. The add-on gained popularity internationally and remains highly regarded.</p>

            <h2>Return to Security and Training</h2>
            <img src="images\CodyAndBorderPatrol.png" class="img-fluid m-2 col-lg-2 col-md-1 col-sm-12 float-start"/>
            <p>Feeling a deep calling to return to protecting others, Cody pursued formal training in anti-terrorism and became certified as an anti-terrorism officer. He then transitioned to working in intelligence gathering and participated in operations focused on combating narcotics and human trafficking along the U.S.-Mexico border. Cody's expertise in computer technology, electronics, and physics enhanced his effectiveness in these operations.</p>
            
            <img src="images\Cody_TeamPic.jpg" class="img-fluid m-2 col-lg-2 col-md-1 col-sm-12 float-end"/>
            <p>In 2020, Cody decided to share his skills and experiences by becoming an instructor. He became certified as an NRA instructor for pistol, rifle, shotgun, and personal protection, as well as a DPS unarmed and armed guard instructor. He opened Attanaya Warrior Institute, a state-of-the-art firearms simulation training facility, offering immersive and realistic training experiences.</p>
            <p>
                
                <h2>Privateer Security Forces</h2>
                <p>In late 2020, Cody merged his passion for training with his security expertise and founded Privateer Security Forces. Serving as the owner and managing partner, Cody leads the company, offering comprehensive security services. He also serves as the owner and commander of Privateer Academy, leveraging his extensive knowledge to train the next generation of protectors.</p>
